# About Deep Complex Networks
1. Models of ordinary deep learning update parameters in the real numbers area.
2. But should it be real number? Can you think about deep learning model in the field of complex numbers?
3. Deep learning in complex numbers has more expressive power than in the real numbers. (It is said that there are many advantages.)
4. This paper introduces the neural network module in the field of multiple numbers, and introduces some active functions as possible.
In this repo, the solution networks and proposed activation functions are implemented.  
It then examines the performance of active functions in the complex numbers and examines the following mathematical issues.
